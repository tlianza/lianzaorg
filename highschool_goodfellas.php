		The story of the Goodfellas is a long and largely unfunny one.  If you have
		seen <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0099685">the movie</a>, then you know 
		who the real goodfellas were.  Basically they were mobsters who were so powerful
		that they could do whatever they wanted.  We are absolutely nothing like them.
		After seeing the movie though, we decided that we would be the goodfellas.  We
		started acting like we could do whatever we wanted when clearly that wasn't the case.
		In a movie theatre, if the movie didn't start on time we would say "start the movie!
		There are goodfellas here!"  And if we ran a traffic light, we would just say
		"it's okay, we're goodfellas."  It was completely ridiculous because obviously 
		we are a bunch of nobodies.
		<div class="largesect">What do you do?</div>
		To be perfectly honest, we don't do anything.  We live in a boring town and don't
		have much to keep us entertained.  As time has passed, we started to notice sayings
		appear in our rhetoric such as "it's gettin' late, boys" coined by Callahan.  He would 
		always say this before he went home, regardless of what time it was.  Then there's the
		ever present "good times."  It is said in complete sarcasm whenever we're sitting 
		around bored out of our minds.
		<p>
		Despite, and perhaps because of the fact there is so little to do, we do funny things.
		Below you will find a sampling of these occurences.
		</p>
		<div class="boxed_item">
		Schulte is always known for his driving antics.  A common "prank" is to take his hands 
		off the wheel, turn full around, and talk to the backseat passengers while he is driving.  
		The funny part of this joke is not just that the passengers are scared, but also that 
		they are right to be scared because he actually isn't driving the car and they could
		die at any moment.
		</div>
		<br />
		<div class="boxed_item">
		Callahan, while driving in Sarge's car notices that the CD is skipping.  He ejects it
		and sees that it says "Schulte's CD" on it.  He starts thinking "oh, this is just 
		Schulte's CD, Sarge must have stolen it from him." and figures he'd throw it out.
		Then he notices that the "SC" in "Schulte" are really the "SC" he writes on his CD's
		to stand for "Steve Callahan."  Some time ago, Schulte stole Callahan's CD and wrote 
		his name on it, then Sarge stole it from Schulte, and Callahan finally got it back
		by accident now that it was ruined.
		</div>
		<br />
		<div class="boxed_item">
		A hilarious gag that has never gotten old is the "spoil the end of the movie for your friends"
		gag.  We do this regularly.  After having several movies spoiled for him, Schulte decided that
		he would get back at us by telling us the endings of other current films.  Of course, he didn't
		actually see these other films - he went online and found the endings just so he could ruin it
		for the rest of us, while ruining them all for him in the process.

		<div class="largesect">The Goodfella By-Laws</div>
		<ol>
<li class="bylaw">If you date a fat chick, expect the consequences.</li>
<li class="bylaw">Whenever you have your friends over, expect glass to break-or other personal belongings (including the clothes on your back) to burn.</li>
<li class="bylaw">Do not ask, "What time is it?" You already know the answer.</li>
<li class="bylaw">Never reveal to anyone exactly which Mobil it is that you are always "going to," including other Goodfellas.</li>
<li class="bylaw">If you say something stupid, expect to pay the price. "The price" may include being beaten with hockey sticks, shards of glass, and pieces of wood with affixed nails. Try not to say anything stupid again. If you slip however, fall on the floor and pray your friends will find this funny.</li>
<li class="bylaw">If Sarge has "The Move" on you, saying "I love Beaver" does not constitute being a pansy.</li>
<li class="bylaw">If you are going nowhere in life, expect your friends to point this fact out to you-numerous times, and in front of other people, even attractive women and strangers.</li>
<li class="bylaw">Retail employment does not constitute a meaningful occupation.</li>
<li class="bylaw">Never hesitate to call your friends, especially on their cell phones. Even when they are sitting a row behind you at the movie theatre. Note: other people finding this behavior annoying and/or retarded does not negate or impact this rule in any form.</li>
<li class="bylaw">If you friends lock you out of their apartment, breaking the door down is perfectly acceptable behavior. Especially when they "had it coming."</li>
<li class="bylaw">No matter how much you believe that placing an "s" in front of someone's first name, then calling them the name directly to their face, especially in a loud voice, can be done without the person recognizing you are referring to them, you are wrong. Example: if you call Kim "Skim" she will know you are talking to her, though you may believe you are behaving in a surreptitious manner.</li>
<li class="bylaw">If your friends decide to make fun of you incessantly for a night, week, or even a month, take it like a man. Their time will come eventually.</li>
<li class="bylaw">Throwing another's keys into the woods does not constitute an offense worthy of being banished from the Goodfellas, even if all members in good standing sign your dismissal. However, having the last name "Sargent" is a dismissable offense. Dating McCracken is automatic dismissal, mind you. Note: if you are a Goodfella, never date McCracken. Never sleep with her. Never take her back. She is evil. She is the devil. You hear us Sargent? Stay away from her.</li>
<li class="bylaw">Never forget that accidents do happen. For instance, in the dark it is often time difficult to see which hole is which. Such mistakes ought to be forgiven.</li>
<li class="bylaw">The question, "Where's the party at?" is always rhetorical.</li>
<li class="bylaw">It doesn't matter what she looks like or who she is, your girlfriend shall be made fun of, and you, when in close proximity to her, shall be made as uncomfortable as possible.</li>
<li class="bylaw">Associating with either Liz McCracken or The Beaver is unacceptable behavior, and will certainly put you out of favor with The Goodfellas. As is associating with anyone ELSE who has taken it up the ass.</li>
<li class="bylaw">If you wear a nametag at work, you are a failure. Note: a security badge is not a nametag, but rather is a source of respect for all those engaged in meaningful professions.</li>
<li class="bylaw">It is never too early to go home.</li>
<li class="bylaw">The amount of humor a joke possesses increases in direct proportion to the amount of damage and harm it causes.</li>
<li class="bylaw">Words spoken amongst Goodfellas stay between Goodfellas, unless the aforementioned by-law is applicable, then this rule shall be superceded.</li>
<li class="bylaw">All people of Chinese decent, Japanese descent, and all others who have the appearance of such shall be named "Benny Loi." No exceptions, even if they appear to be female or have announced their "real" name, shall be made. </li>
<li class="bylaw">When leaving Goodfella Callahan's house, it shall be obligatory that you invite Benny Loi to wherever it is that you might be going. This rule shall be mandated in all cases, not limited to those when Benny Loi's father is outside doing yardwork. In such a case, it shall be expected that you make the invitation in a louder than normal voice, as to cause far more humiliation.</li>
<li class="bylaw">Never expect Sargent to pay for anything. However, if Sargent believes that something of yours is his, and you attempt to take it back, such as any alcoholic beverage, expect to defend yourself, including, when applicable, in a full fledged wrestling match. </li>
<li class="bylaw">Callahan is the only Goodfella who, invariably, brings only ice to a party. However, do not be fooled by his declaration that ice, in any way, is valuable or expensive, no matter how much ice he might bring. He is "Jewing" you out of money, plain and simple.</li>
<li class="bylaw">Never mention anything about green cards in front of The Goodfellas, as several of its members have dated and still date those who might, with legitimate fear, take offense and/or flee the surrounding area at the mention of those words.</li>
<li class="bylaw">It is not racist to assume that Deion has stolen or is in the process of stealing any of your VCRs or any other electronic device. Remember and do not forget that Deion is black.</li>
<li class="bylaw">A night spent watching Jeopardy constitutes having partied. This is also true for watching porn.</li>
<li class="bylaw">If you get hung up on a girlfriend, and she dumps you and you cry, an acceptable description of these events is "I told that bitch where to stick it."</li>
<li class="bylaw">Going on a vacation, just you and a sibling, is perfectly normal behavior. You will not be subject to ridicule and jokes of incestuous behavior, no matter how many times you had sex with them on the trip.</li>
<li class="bylaw">Your level of participation in the writing and publishing of the Goodfellas' Newsletter is inversely proportional to the amount of jokes at your expense contained therein.</li>
<li class="bylaw">Small increments of time are to be measured in "Korkins." This standard unit, representing approximately thirty seconds, can be used in other instances, as well, mostly to characterize disappointing sexual performance in general.</li>
<li class="bylaw">Regardless of historically accuracy, it is understood that Goodfella Schulte, due to his German heritage, is a direct descendent of Adolph Hitler.</li>
<li class="bylaw">Honorary Goodfella status may be granted or revoked at will. While holding this status, it is to be understood that you are given no special privileges and that the status itself is absolutely meaningless.</li>
<li class="bylaw">Extreme sarcasm shall be noted by making quote-mark hand signals with the index and middle fingers. Example: &quot;That by-law you just wrote, Tom, was really [quote signal] funny [quote signal].&quot;</li>

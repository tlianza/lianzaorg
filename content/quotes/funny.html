            <li>Isn't it weird that we drink milk, stuff designed to nourish baby cows? How did THAT happen?  Did some cattleman once say, "Oh, man, I can't wait till them calves are done so I can get ME a hit of that stuff."</li>

<h2>A Plan for the Improvement of English Spelling (by Mark Twain)</h2>
For example, in Year 1 that useless letter "c" would be dropped to be replased either by "k" or "s", and likewise "x" would
no longer be part of the alphabet. The only kase in which "c" would be retained would be the "ch" formation, which will be
dealt with later. Year 2 might reform "w" spelling, so that "which" and "one" would take the same konsonant, wile Year 3
might well abolish "y" replasing it with "i" and Iear 4 might fiks the "g/j" anomali wonse and for all. Jenerally,
then, the improvement would kontinue iear bai iear with Iear 5 doing awai with useless double konsonants,
and Iears 6-12 or so modifaiing vowlz and the rimeining voist and unvoist konsonants. Bai Iear 15 or sou, it wud

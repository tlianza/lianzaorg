Moving from Ruby to C# left me missing some of the great tools the Ruby ecosystem had relied on, including hosted error
tracking. <a href="https://github.com/exceptional/exceptional">Exceptional</a> was one of those tools, and it did not
have a .NET compatible client, so I wrote one and open-sourced it on
<a href="https://archive.codeplex.com/index.html?p=getexceptional">Codeplex</a>.

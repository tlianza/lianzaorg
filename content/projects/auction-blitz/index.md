For the Intro to Electronic Commerce class we created this site based on some 
research on auction theory. It is similar in format to ebay, but instead of one 
auction type we implemented three. It could theoretically replace the current CMU 
system misc.market because the "sealed bid" option allows people to trade goods 
instead of simply buying or selling them.

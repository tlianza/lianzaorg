I've really enjoyed Pivotal Tracker as a development tool, but generating reports for businesspeople to see high-level
status was not possible. I built this tool using Sinatra and the Pivotal Tracker API to generate reports that could be
emailed out on a weekly basis. They can group by label (to see where we're spending the most resources) and highlight in
red or green if we're resolving ore stories than we're creating over a given time period.

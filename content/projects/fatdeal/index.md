This site was started as an independent study, but is no longer active at fatdeal.com. It allows online shoppers to
look for coupons at their favorite stores. Member features allow people to store coupons in a "coupon wallet",
keep an eye on their favorite sites, and set up coupon alerts based on their preferences. Chalk this up as
another failed dot-com.

Human emotions can be boiled down to <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2014/02/study-humans-have-only-four-feelings.html">four feelings</a>.
This is a simple, mobile-friendly counter to let you track your
feelings throughout the day. When you think of it, open the page and click the green box representing the feeling you're
feeling right at that moment. At the end of the day, look back at the totals and see how you felt.
It's an interesting exercise that might surprise you.

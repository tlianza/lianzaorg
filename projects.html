	<li><b>Group Members:</b> <a href="http://fortes.com/">Fil</a>, <a href="http://jonahb.com">Jonah</a></li>
	<li><b>Date:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Conceived in Late 2005, Developed in Early 2008</li>
	<li><b>Description:</b> Written with Ruby on Rails 2.0 and MySQL, allows people to battle two jokes together.  Uses full RESTful-routing and REST-based techniques. Also developed a Facebook app with the <a href="http://facebooker.rubyforge.org/">facebooker plugin</a>. </li>

	<ul class="projectattributes">
	<li><b>Date:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;March 2008</li>
	<li><b>Description:</b> This Google Maps mashup plots the Patriots Fan Clubs across the world, and allows you to zoom in, and search for them.  It uses the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/">Google Maps API</a> to generate the map, and the Geocoding API to look up the latitude and longitude of new clubs when they are created.</li>
	<li><b>Technologies:</b> ColdFusion 8, REST/XML</li>

				<li><b>Date:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;2005</li>
				<li><b>Description:</b> There are a lot of great bandwidth testers out there (<a href="http://www.dslreports.com/stest">DSLReports</a>, <a href="http://www.speakeasy.net/speedtest/">Speakeasy</a>, etc.) but no free/open source solutions I could find.  The problem with a hosted bandwidth tester is that your results are subject to their bandwidth.  By having one of my own I can drop it on any computer and test the connectivity between them.  This project is no longer under development, but I was looking to build more functionality into it, including traceroute utilities (which are surprisingly hard to implement in Java because they require access to raw sockets) and possibly other monitoring/troubleshooting tools... VoIP, QoS, etc.  This utility is implemented using a Java <a href="http://java.sun.com/applets/" title="What is an applet?">Applet</a> with a Swing UI, and it tests uploads by making calls back to a Servlet.  It can therefore be conveniently packaged up in a WAR file and dropped into Tomcat as a webapp.</li>
				<li><b>Technologies:</b> Java, Swing, Applet</li>

	<div class="sectionheader"><a title="Not online - private app">Delivery Scheduling</a></div>
	<img src="images/screen_usoil.gif" width="225" height="163" alt="Delivery Scheduling" border="1">
	<ul class="projectattributes">
	<li><b>Date:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Current (2004-2005)</li>
	<li><b>Description:</b> Developed a system for scheduling deliveries of motor oil.  It uses a DHTML-based front end for manually laying out the schedule in a drag-and-drop fashion.  Delivery schedules are projected and arranged based on delivery and consumption history. </li>
	<li><b>Technologies:</b>It is JSP-based with a <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> backend using the <a href="http://www.springframework.org/">Spring</a> framework.</li>

	<ul class="projectattributes">
	<li><b>Group members:</b> Jerry Yoo, Kriti Bhandari, Chris Ghazaryans</li>
	<li><b>Date:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;May 2001 / February 2003</li>
	<li><b>Description:</b> This project was originally done as part of the <a href="http://www.mism.cmu.edu/desc.asp?menu=currentStudentsMenu&menuSection=CourseDescription&course=95-702" title="95-702 Organizational Communication and Distributed Object Technologies">Distributed Object Technologies</a> course, implemented in both <a href="http://www.corba.org/">CORBA</a> and <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/rmi/">RMI</a>.  I later rewrote it, and it is currently implemented as a <a href="http://webservices.org/index.php/article/articleview/429/1/61/" title="webservices.org - Tell me about Web services, and make it quick">web service</a> running under <a href="http://ws.apache.org/axis/" title="Apache Axis home page">Apache Axis</a>.  The concept is simple - there are plenty of <a href="http://directory.google.com/Top/Home/Consumer_Information/Price_Comparisons/">price comparison</a> sites, but in order to use them, you have to go visit them.  In other words, you either have to do your shopping from their site, or shop at another site and then go to their site to find the product (shop twice).  We wanted to create something whereby you can shop at your favorite site, then click a button and see prices at other stores.  This application detects what product your looking at, then goes out to other retailers and finds their prices in real time (no database required). </li>
	<li><b>Technologies:</b> Java, SOAP, Apache Axis</li>

		<li><b>Date:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;December 2000</li>
		<li><b>Group members:</b> Gabe Chua, Tara Dwivedi, Lauren Holz, Bill Long, Eunjae Lim</li>
		<li><b>Description:</b> This site was for our senior Information Systems project course.  It is currently online at <a href="http://www.loveandrespect.com/"><b>loveandrespect.com</b></a>.  Our team worked with the client, Dr. Emerson Eggerichs, to create an online presence for his business.

		<li><b>Date:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;November 2000</li>
		<li><b>Group members:</b> Bill Long</li>
		<li><b>Description:</b> This site was started as an independent study, but is no longer active at fatdeal.com.  It allows online shoppers to look for coupons at their favorite stores.  Member features allow people to store coupons in a "coupon wallet", keep an eye on their favorite sites, and set up coupon alerts based on their preferences.  Chalk this up as another failed dot-com.</li>

	<li><b>Date:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;November 2000</li>
	<li><b>Group members:</b> Ben Pillet, Mike Walsh, Cameron White</li>
	<li><b>Description:</b> For the Intro to Electronic Commerce class we created this site based on some research on auction theory.  It is similar in format to <a href="http://www.ebay.com">ebay</a>, but instead of one auction type we implemented three.  It could theoretically replace the current CMU system misc.market because the "sealed bid" option allows people to trade goods instead of simply buying or selling them.</li>

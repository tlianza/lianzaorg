				<h2>Fatdeal</h2>
                <img src="../images/screen_fatdeal.jpg" width="225" height="123" target="_blank" border="1" />
				<p>This site was started as an independent study, but is no longer active at fatdeal.com. It allows online shoppers to look for coupons at their favorite stores.
                    Member features allow people to store coupons in a "coupon wallet", keep an eye on their favorite sites, and set up coupon alerts based on their preferences.
                    Chalk this up as another failed dot-com.</p>

				<h2>Auction Blitz</h2>
                <img src="../images/screen_auction.jpg" width="225" height="125" alt="" border="1" />
				<p>For the Intro to Electronic Commerce class we created this site based on some research on auction theory.
                    It is similar in format to ebay, but instead of one auction type we implemented three. It could
                    theoretically replace the current CMU system misc.market because the "sealed bid" option allows
                    people to trade goods instead of simply buying or selling them.</p>

				<h2>Album Greetings</h2>
                <img src="../images/screen_album.jpg" width="225" height="125" alt="" border="1" />
				<p>This was a project for the junior level information systems project course.
                    It was an online photo album that allowed people to upload photographs, configure and manage
                    multiple photo albums, and share these albums with friends by creating passworded albums.</p>

				<h2>Where Is Bob?</h2>

				<p>This site was launched at whereisbob.com and began as a project for Web Business Engineering. It was an online game that allowed visitors to hunt around a map for this character named Bob.
                    If they sign up for membership, they were able to earn points, keep statistics, and store the clues they picked up during the search.</p>

                    This site was used by students at Carnegie Mellon's GSIA to report their job offers.
                    Administrative features allow career center personnel to review and verify the offers, and receive
                    nightly e-mail notifications about which students accepted which offers each day.
